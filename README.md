# EvilHades-DiscordBotjs
I have a cat called Hades, and I've made this discord music bot. 
I made one, long time ago but it was on 13 version and I didn't knew much about code, and this specific I'm gonna try update him all the time, to help people that are learning discordjs!

# Requirements:
   [<img title="Node.js" alt="Node.js" height=50px width=50px src="https://icon-library.com/images/nodejs-icon/nodejs-icon-1.jpg" />](https://nodejs.org) [<img title="FFmpeg" alt="FFmpeg" height=50px width=50px src="https://icon-library.com/images/ffmpeg-icon/ffmpeg-icon-20.jpg" />](https://ffmpeg.org/)

   The others dependencies are on 'package.json' file, that you can use 'npm i' or 'npm install' on terminal that you gonna install it

> Use '!deploy' to slash commands(Btw the Slash comands were made by Gabriel Tanner)

>Start the bot by typing "Node index.js"
